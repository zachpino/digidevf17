### Homework for 9/14/17

##### Electronics
- Create the button circuit and run [the code sample](electronics.md). What questions do you have (there should be many!)?
- Try to edit the code and electronics hookup from class, detailed in [the code sample](electronics.md), so that when a user presses a button, the led illuminates.
- Try to add a second button and second led, and edit the code so that a user can control two different color leds. Doable?

##### Motion Challenge
Create an object *using any means available other than prefabricated parts*, fitting within an 8" x 8" x 8" box, that...

- moves on its own after intial propulsion
- makes contact with the ground on at least two rolling wheels
- survives being dropped from table height
- continues movement *in the same general direction* if it collides with an anchored object measuring 2" x 2" x 2"
- can travel six linear feet in less than 30 seconds, while rolling on its own wheels under its own guidance (i.e. without a human holding it)
- has some style

A rugged toy car with four wheels passes all of these tests, but that's boring!
