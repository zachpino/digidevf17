### Homework for 9/14/17

##### Electronics
- Edit the code and electronics hookup from class, detailed in [the code sample](electronics.md), so that when a user presses a button, the led illuminates.
- Add a second button and second led, and edit the code so that a user can control two different color leds.

##### Programming
Make a python shell script `worldlyhello.py` that takes a language as input, and outputs "hello world" in that language, or returns an understandable error.

```
python worldlyhello.py spanish
Buenos Dias, el mundo
```

```
python worldlyhello.py somali
salaam dunida oa dhan
```

Support at least five languages, and if a user enters an unincluded language, offer help.

```
python worldlyhello.py burmese
Sorry, worldlyhello only supports arabic, spanish, somali, vietnamese, and inuktitut.
```

Make good use of `if` and `elif`!

##### Motion Challenge
Create an object, fitting within an 8" x 8" x 8" box, that...

- moves on its own after intial propulsion
- makes contact with the ground on at least two rolling wheels
- survives being dropped from table height
- continues movement *in the same general direction* if it collides with an anchored object in its path measuring 2" x 2" x 2"
- can travel six linear feet in less than 30 seconds, while rolling on its own wheels
- has some style

A rugged toy car with four wheels passes all of these tests, but that's boring!
