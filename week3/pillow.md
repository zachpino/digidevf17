### Shell Scripts and Python Library: Pillow and Image Manipulation

It is straightforward to make a text file containing Python code run through the command line.

```
mkdir ~/Desktop/pillow
cd ~/Desktop/pillow/
touch pillow.md
nano pillow.md
```

We can type in python code into the `nano` text editor to create programs to run.
