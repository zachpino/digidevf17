### Digital and Electronic Prototyping Tools Usage Agreement

I, ________________________________________________, agree to follow all communicated rules and regulations surrounding the use of the Institute of Design Fabrication Lab's [the "Shop"] laser cutter, CNC Machine, Tech Bench, and 3D printers. 

Throughout all of my time using these machines, I will...

- set up the equipment and files in accordance with published documentation or in-class demonstration
- use only materials from the "Approved Materials" lists.
- never use materials from the "Forbidden Materials" lists.
- ensure that I am at an appropriate level of wakefulness and awareness
- vigilantly supervise the machine while it is in operation
- not take any medication or substance that forbids or discourages "the use of heavy machinery."
- not disrupt another student's work in progress unless they have left the machine and their work unattended
- report any damage to the machines to Shop staff

If I am ever uncertain about how to use Shop equipment, I will reach out to my fellow students, Faculty, Shop Staff, or Shop Managers to learn about the machines, prepare my files, and operate the machinery appropriately. 

If I -- through intentional violation of the above rules -- endanger myself, the Shop's equipment, the ID Shop environment, or other students, I agree to forfeit my access to specific equipment, use of the Shop for the duration of my career at ID, and/or all future TA and Faculty Research positions at ID. I agree that the punishment is fully at the discretion of the Director of Student Engagement, and will be enforced by ID administration, the Shop manager, faculty supervisors, and student Shop Monitors.
