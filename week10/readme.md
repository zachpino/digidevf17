### End of Semester Schedule and Final Briefs
The end of the semester is approaching, and there are only a few weeks left to cover a lot of material.

- 11/02 - Walking Systems, Computer Vision, and Python Classes
- 11/09 - Flying Systems, Rotations, and Python Dictionaries
- 11/13 - Premptive Make-Up Class? Scheduled Worktime
- 11/16 - Worktime
- 11/23 - Thankgiving Holiday | *No Class*
- 11/30 - Worktime
- 12/07 - Final Critique

You have a choice in your final brief. Select one of the following projects and complete the deliverables by our final critique date (12/07). Your work will be evaluated on concept, ambition, research rigor, and execution.

*Perfected functionality* is much less important than demonstrated and consistent effort, perseverence, and broad exploration. This project can be approached individually or in teams of two.

#### Brief 1 - Search & Rescue Robot (Sensor and Data Analysis Focus)

Select a manmade or natural catastrophe that would require robotic assistance and an environment in which that catastrophe is likely to occur. For instance, an extreme blizzard would likely strike mountainous, rocky, and high altitude regions. Once that choice is made, research the environment and *design a robotic system capable of finding and/or rescuing life and/or other specific materials*.

The choice of movement system should be tied to research into the catastophe. A rolling locomotory system, for example. would be a poor choice for mountainous terrain -- while an ambulatory, scansorial, or flighted system would be a better fit.

> Requirements
> - At least two sensors should be used to synthesize a computational awareness of the environment.
> - The robot must be mobile with at least one motor/servo/stepper driving some  
> - The robot must 

> Deliverables
>- Raspberry Pi-controlled robot demonstrating core functionality in a recreation of the environment for which it is designed
>- Commented Python code with links to all included modules
>- Project Documentation through a sequence of annotated photgraphs 
- Set of images demonstrating how the robot *sees* its world
- Single Poster Design, 18"x24", for the project (doesn't need to be printed, should be legible when projected)
- 

Brief 2 - The Mobile Robot (Electronics and Kinetics Focus)
Study how some specific natural organism moves, and through a combination of motors and other kinetic mechanisms, recreate that motion synthetically. 

Brief 3 - The Support Robot (Social Design and Design Futures Focus)
Read through the full text of this [National Institute of Health call for proposals (CFP)](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-17-107.html) that seeks ideas on how future robotic systems can support aging individuals with Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's-disease-related dementias through both physical and emotional assistance. 

Generate a set of insights based on secondary research, and prototype a support robot that addresses some aspect of the CFP.

Brief 4 - The Reactive Robot (for all you contrarian designers!)
Envision a scenario where a Rasperry Pi or Raspberry Pi Zero could be embedded, along with at least 1 motor and at least 2 sensors, in a designed object that *proactively engages some user* through motion and algorithmic awareness. 

Deliverables and requirements will be scoped in conversation with Zach.
