- 11/09 - Flying Systems, Rotations, and Python Dictionaries
- 11/13 - Premptive Make-Up Class? Scheduled Worktime
- 11/16 - Worktime
- 11/23 - Thankgiving Holiday *No Class*
- 11/30 - Worktime
- 12/07 - Final Critique

You have a choice in your final brief. Select one of the following projects and complete the deliverables by our final critique. Your work will be evaluated on concept, ambition, and 

*Perfected functionality* is much less important than demonstrated effort and exploration. 

Brief 1 - Search & Rescue Robot
Select a manmade or natural catastrophe that would require robotic assistance and an environment in which that catastrophe is likely to occur. For instance, an extreme blizzard would likely strike mountainous, rocky, regions. Once that choice is made, research the environment and design a robotic system capable of finding and/or rescuing life or other valuable materials.

The choice of movement system should be tied to research into the catastophe. A rolling locomotory system would be a poor choice for 

Requirements
- At least two sensors should be used to synthesize a computational awareness of the environment.

Deliverables
- Raspberry Pi-controlled robot demonstrating core functionality
- Commented Python code with links to all included modules
- Project Documentation through a sequence of annotated photgraphs 
- Single Poster, 18"x24", of how the 


Brief 2 - Biomimetic Experimentation

Brief 3 - Choose Your Own Adventure
Envision a scenario where a Rasperry Pi or Raspberry Pi Zero could be embedded, along with at least 1 motor and at least 2 sensors, in a designed outcome to *proactively engage users* through motion and awareness.
