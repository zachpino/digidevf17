### Homework for 10/19

##### Motion Challenge : Chilly Robot v2
Using *any means available*, create a robot that can...

- Turn on
- Take a temperature reading
- Move in a cardinal direction (forward, left, right, back)
- Take a temperature reading
- Return to the starting position
- Move towards the other cardinal directions and take readings there
- If the original position was hottest, indicate with an onboard RGB LED that a hotspot was discovered and then randomly move to a new position (bonus: could it leave behind a marker?).
- Otherwise, move towards the hottest reading
- Repeat

The net effect should be a robot that is capable of exploring a 2-dimensional space autonomously, and identify anomolously warm spots.

Extra Challenge: could a button be used as a collision sensor?

##### Other RasPi Uses
Investigate another use for your Raspberry Pi over break. Game console, musical instrument, under tv media box, scientific cluster... Report back to class after break.

##### Purchases
