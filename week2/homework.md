### Motion Challenge for 9/7/17

Take the acrylic sphere handed out in class, and with a partner -- using *any means available to you* -- make the sphere reliably and recreatably...

- ... sit still at an obvious starting position...
- ... begin moving at a user-specified time...
- ... traverse exactly *6 linear feet*...
- ... in as close to *30 seconds* as possible...
- ... and come to a complete stop.

Submit a gif or mp4 to Blackboard of the results. If possible, do not disassemble the creations. Submissions will be evaluated for creativity and ambition. 

A human holding the ball, rolling it down a 6' tube (inclined to a 30 second traversal time), into a waiting cup satisfies the baseline assignment. But, that's boring.
