### Fading a PWM Component 

Use this sort of logic to smoothly fade an LED, spin up or slow down a motor, or move a servo into place.

```python
#necessary dependencies
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
import time

#pin layouts for common cathode RGB LED
rPin = 12
gPin = 16
bPin = 20
 
#set 'one-way streets' to run away from the RasPi
GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
GPIO.setup(rPin, GPIO.OUT)
GPIO.setup(gPin, GPIO.OUT)
GPIO.setup(bPin, GPIO.OUT)

#variable for frequency
freq = 100

#set the used GPIO pins to PWM mode at 100hz
red = GPIO.PWM(rPin,freq)
red.start(0)
green = GPIO.PWM(gPin,freq)
green.start(0)
blue = GPIO.PWM(bPin,freq)
blue.start(0)

#variable to hold the state of the leds -- increasing or decreasing in brightness
count = "up"

#loop forever
while True :
 #check if the led should be increasing in brightness
 if count == "up" :
  print("ascending")
  #increment the red pin all the way up to full intensity
  for i in range(1,100):
   red.ChangeDutyCycle(i)
   time.sleep(.1)
  #set the flag to decrease the brightness of the leds after fully illuminating
  count = "down"

 elif count == "down" :
  print("descending")
  for i in range(1,100):
   red.ChangeDutyCycle(100 - i)
   time.sleep(.1)
  count = "up"
```
